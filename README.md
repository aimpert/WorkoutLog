# WorkoutLog

Weightlifting Log app for Android. The concept is to have something I can use that is basic and has the tools and a clean UI for logging my workouts. This project
will help me develop skills for app development through Java and Android Studio, as well as UI design, and possible use of a database system such as SQL. 
Fundamentally, a workout log app is something that can be contionously expanded upon after creating the core features. Initially the app is meant to be a 5/3/1
weightlifting app as it is the current routine I am running. Therefore modularity is something to work on, as allowing the user to customize their workout plan 
beyond 5/3/1 will add a ton of flexibility and depth to the application.

August Priority List:

~~1. Create a functioning training max (TM) and one rep max (1RM) calculator.~~

2. Store this data somewhere so that it can be accessed between activities.

3. Choose a system for archiving old data (previous 1RMs, TMs).

4. Develop a log for these old numbers.

5. Clean and optimize application.
    * Error handling
    * Test cases
    * Usability
